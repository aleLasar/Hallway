# Hallway: Interactive graphical environment for creation of sound and musical scores
## Thesis project for bachelor's degree in composition for electronic music

Technological development, especially in recent years, has undoubtedly influenced the way which musical compositions are written and created. New technologies have not only brought new ways to create innovative tonal sounds but they also changed the way in which music can be expressed by giving composers new tools to represent theirs artistic ideas. 

A field of development that is becoming very popular and that continues to attract new ones research is the introduction of videogames into audiovisual works. The world of video games in fact, it offers composers not only new ways of organizing sound material but also how to review the relationship with the public by creating clearer and more immersive contents. 

From these considerations this thesis work was born, which aims to deepen the use of video games within musical compositions.

The thesis work is developed in two main parts: 
1. A new concept of score which uses concepts and dynamics from the world of videogames to codify the movements of the hands of the performers.
2. An example of how this score can be used to create musical compositions by presenting its possible sonorization.
